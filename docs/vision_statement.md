## The Problem We Solve

### Traditional Fashion Design Challenges

1. **High Technical Barrier**
   - Pattern making requires years of specialized training
   - 3D-to-2D conversion is complex and error-prone
   - Manual pattern drafting is time-consuming

2. **Massive Fabric Waste**
   - Traditional layout methods achieve 70-75% fabric utilization
   - Fashion industry generates 92 million tons of waste annually
   - 15-20% of fabric is wasted in the cutting room

3. **Slow Production Cycles**
   - Weeks from design concept to production-ready patterns
   - Iterative fitting and adjustments require manual rework
   - Delays in sample creation and approval

4. **Limited Design Exploration**
   - Cost and time constraints limit design iterations
   - Difficult to visualize fabric draping before production
   - Challenges in predicting fit and comfort
